_Default passwords for IoT devices and for web applications (for ex. MySQL and PostgreSQL admin panels)._ üê±‚Äçüíª

_Useful for fans of Shodan, Censys and Google dorks._

- [x] in progress

## Motivation

- one document for the vendors default credentials with high-quality entries
- encouragent participation in the open source community by taking part in [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/)
- archiving credentials of no longer available in the web

## Stats

Number of collected default passwords: ``2814``. ‚úîÔ∏è

Places in the world where the [project page](https://many-passwords.github.io/) was displayed:

As you can see, most people are from India, Russia and United States. The goal is for the entire map to turn blue.

## Navigation

Credentials are in the [passwords.csv](https://github.com/many-passwords/many-passwords/blob/main/passwords.csv) file (the data is in the form of a table) or [project website](https://many-passwords.github.io/).

Each entries contains: ``Vendor``, ``Model/Software name``, ``Version``, ``Access Type``, ``Username``, ``Password``, ``Privileges`` and ``Notes``.

### Pass Station

[Pass Station](https://github.com/noraj/pass-station) is CLI & library to search for default credentials, created by [@noraj](https://github.com/noraj).  
As of [1.2.3 version](https://github.com/noraj/pass-station/releases/tag/v1.2.3) _Many passwords_ have been added as one of the sources of credentials.
